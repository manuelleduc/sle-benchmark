# Challenges

**DRAFT**


## Challenges categories

- language extension
- language specialization/restriction
- language unification
- language self-extension
- language - model co-evolution

<!-- Can multiple inheritance be modeled in term of Erdweg classification?  -->
- workbenches collaboration

- composition of scopes
- composition of type systems
- composition of execution context
- composition of code transformations (e.g. model to text)


## Reuse challenges

- linear composition
  - on a single level
  - on multiple levels


## Reverse engineering challenges

- dead code analysis: can the workbench provided tools to identified unused part on the reused language concerns?
