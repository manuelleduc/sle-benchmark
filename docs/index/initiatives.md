MetaLib is a chrestomathy for metaprogramming. That is, the implementation of a domain-specific language is approached with different metaprogramming technologies in a manner that caters for comparison and is meant to be useful for technology documentation and learning.


## Language Workbenches

**DEAD PROJECT**

This site offers an annual call for participation to the implementation of
languages using language workbenches. it also reference the implementations
submitted each year.

The knowledge aggregated from this call for participation lead to the
publication of a paper that described the state of the art of language
workbenches as observed from the submissions to the proposed challenges.

One of the crucial contribution of the paper is the identification of the design
space of language workbenches in the form of a feature model.


## SLEBok - The Software Language Engineering Body of knowledge

The SLEBok (Software Language Engineering Body of knowledge) is a collaborative
effort to centralize the SLE related knowledge. It take currently the shape of
of a public github repository open to external contributions
