# Open Problems

This page references the identified [Challenges](../challenges) without any
identified [Solution](../solutions).

A missing solution can be identified either by the lack of scientific
literature addressing the problem, or by the absence of a solution
covering the full scope of the problem according to a set of constraints.

For example a solution might exist for a given challenge but with no
support for incremental compilation, or poor runtime performances.
