# Properties

## Functional Properties

- **reusability:** can we quantify how much a define Language is reusable as a building block of future languages?
- **model compatibility:** does it exist a notion of language typing. Does the model produced defined using a Language *A* be executable using a Language *B* with a children type relationship to *A*.

## Non Functional Properties


**TODO:** Cf draft paper.

# To be defined

- Can the language concern be distributed as an well identified set of black-box software artifacts (e.g. maven artifacts)?
