# SLE Composition Benchmark

## Introduction

Multiple ongoing works already exists as ways to quantify advances in the field
of SLE.

Given the increasing production of SLE artifacts, the need for reuse of existing
language artifacts is getting more and more crucial. However, the SLE community
does not have access to a benchmark in order to compare reuse approaches of
languages.

Current SLE benchmarks initiatives can be found [here](./index/initiatives.md)




## Software Language Engineering

From the [SLEBoK](https://github.com/slebok/slebok) words, the field of
Software Language Engineering (SLE) has emerged based on a strong motivation to
connect and integrate different research disciplines such as compiler
construction, reverse engineering, software transformation, model-driven
engineering, and ontologies.
SLE is defined as the application of systematic,disciplined, and measurable
approaches to the development, deployment, use, and maintenance of Software
Languages.

## Benchmark

Using a benchmark is a recognized methodology that, when embraced by the
community, has strong positive effects on the scientific maturity of the field.

More details on the methodology and criterion used for the construction and
analysis of the benchmark can be found in the [Benchmarks](./benchmark/index.md)
section.
The proposed challenges are in the [Challenges](./challenges/index.md) section.
